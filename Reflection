After completing four SQL Leetcode problems, here's what i learned:

1. A standard SQL query consists of three majoy keywords: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE
2. The DISTINCT keyword is reserved to use in queries where the row has distinct values. In other words, it rules out duplicate values
3. The keyword ORDER BY returns a table wirh values in ascending order.
