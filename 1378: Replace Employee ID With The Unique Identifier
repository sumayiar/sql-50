# Write your MySQL query statement below
#Inserting pseudocode to straighten out my thought process
#This SQL query has to return the unique ID of each user.
#This problem deals with joining both the Employees and EmployeeUNI table.

#First, I will select the id and names
SELECT unique_id, name
#Next, I will select the value from the Employees table
FROM Employees
#Then, I will join those values with the values from the EmployeeUNI table
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI 
#Lastly, I will check to see if the values match
ON Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id
