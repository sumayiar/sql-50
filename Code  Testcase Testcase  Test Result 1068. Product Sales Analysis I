# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Look at what the questions asks for
SELECT product_name, year, price
# The question wants these three values
FROM Sales
# from the Sales table
JOIN Product 
ON Sales.product_id = Product.product_id
# Both tables share the product_id attribute. That's how you can join them.
