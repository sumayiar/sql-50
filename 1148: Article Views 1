# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT(author_id) as id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY author_id;

#The query must include the distinct keyword because the table has duplicate rows.
#The order by statement fulfills the satisfaction of returning the result table in ascending order.
